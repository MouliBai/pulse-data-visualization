# pulse-data-visualization

This project provides data visualization for Phone Pulse data. It utilizes Streamlit and Plotly to create interactive visualizations based on transaction and user data.

## Project Overview

The Phone Pulse Visualizations project aims to provide insights into transaction and user data collected by Phone Pulse. The application allows users to explore and analyze various aspects of the data through interactive charts and graphs.

## Features

- **Transaction Analysis**: Visualize transaction data based on selected year, quarter, and transaction type. Analyze transaction amounts and counts across different states.
- **User Analysis**: Explore user data based on selected year, quarter, and state. Gain insights into user counts and their distribution.
- **State-Wise Analysis**: Dive deeper into transaction or user analysis for specific states. Compare different states based on their transaction amounts or user counts.
- **Top 10 Analysis**: Identify the top 10 transactions or users based on selected criteria, such as transaction amounts or user counts.
